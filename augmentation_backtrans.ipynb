(f) 3 (three) years from the date of completion for stretches requiring renewal of Bituminous Concrete (BC) layer through either using hot-in-place recycling of the entire BC layer or providing a fresh layer of BC with 40mm thickness. (g) 3 (three) years from the date of completion for stretches requiring improvement to riding quality, in cases other than those mentioned in para (f) above, through laying a layer of BM/DBM and BC. The Defects Liability Period shall commence from the date of the Completion Certificate. For the avoidance of any doubt, any repairs or restoration because of usual wear or tear in the Project Highway or any Section thereof shall form a part of the Maintenance obligations of the Contractor as specified in Article 14. 17.2 Remedying Defects Save and except as provided in Clause 14.1 (iii), the Contractor shall repair or rectify all Defects and deficiencies observed by the Authority or Authority’s Engineer during the Defects Liability Period within a period of 15 (fifteen) days from the date of notice issued by the Authority or Authority’s Engineer in this behalf, or within such reasonable period as may be determined by the Authority or Authority’s Engineer at the request of the Contractor, in accordance with Good Industry Practice. 78 17.3 Cost of remedying Defects Any repair or rectification undertaken in accordance with the provisions of Clause 17.2, including any additional testing, shall be carried out by the Contractor at its own risk and cost, to the extent that such rectification or repair is attributable to: (a) the design of the Project; (b) Plant, Materials or workmanship not being in accordance with this Agreement and the Specifications and Standards; (c) improper maintenance during construction of the Project Highway by the Contractor; and/ or (d) failure by the Contractor to comply with any other obligation under this Agreement. 17.4 Contractor’s failure to rectify Defects If the Contractor fails to repair or rectify such Defect or deficiency within the period specified in Clause 17.2, the Authority shall be entitled to get the same repaired, rectified or remedied at the Contractor’s cost to make the Project Highway conform to the Specifications and Standards and the provisions of this Agreement.
